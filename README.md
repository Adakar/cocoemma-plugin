# Squish Coco Emma plugin

This plugin allows you to capture EMMA-XML reports generated by Squish and display code coverage statistics.

## Usage

### Basic configuration
The plugin provides the post-build **Record Squish Coco Emma Coverage Report** action. The action allows configuring paths to the EMMA-xml report files.  
The path is relative to the workspace root of the Jenkins job.

Once the path is configured and points to the report files generated by Squish Coco, a user can define health report thresholds.
